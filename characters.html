    <h1 class="display-1 text-center">Characters</h1>
    <p class="text-center fs-3">I made an animation series in blender called, Crimson Abyss. For the sake of being
        orginized, there will be two sections, one for the humans and the other for the Void Creatures.</p>
    <section class="text-center fs-2">
        <h1 class="display-1">Humans</h1>
        <img src="images/theGuy.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="The Guy">
        <p>First character we have is The Guy. The Guy is the protagonist of Crimson Abyss. His power is super speed, he
            uses his powers to dodge attacks that no normal person can dodge, and it gives him an advantage to rush down
            and easily win.</p>
        <img src="images/taffy.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Candy">
        <p>Next we have The Guy's brother, Candy. Candy has the power of shapeshifting, anything he has seen, he can
            transform into it. This includes rocks, plants, objects, animals and even other people. It also allows him
            to use the abilities of whoever he transforms into.</p>
        <img src="images/michael.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Michael">
        <p>Michael is one of the characters in the group of heros. Michael's powers represent light, he can shoot lasers
            that are blue in color, and he can fly. Michael was the first person The Guy met when he was in the void.
            Michael also had a twin brother who we will talk about next.</p>
        <img src="images/crim.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Crim">
        <p>Crim and Michael are twins. While Michael's powers represent light, Crim's represent darkness. Crim is the
            Antagonist of Crimson Abyss. Crim was the one who created the void creatures and his powers are the same as
            Michael's, except his color is red.</p>
        <img src="images/purple.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Cannon">
        <p>And for the finial human we'll talk about is Cannon. Cannon is a character introduced in season 2. He has the
            power of telekinesis and psychic abilities. He uses his powers to hover and throw objects or his opponents.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="text-center fs-2">
        <h1 class="display-1">Void Creatures</h1>
        <p>Before we talk about the different void creatures, I'll explain what exactly a void creature is. Void
            creatures are mutated animals that Crim made with his powers. He turns them into a bigger and more deadly
            version of themselves. They are usualy black in color, and have a glowing smiling face.</p>
            <img src="images/fred.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Fred">
        <p>First of the void creatures is Fred. Fred was the first void creature to be created by Crim. A Fred is made
            from an ant. Fred's have two sharp limbs on their back which they use for fighting. There is one Fred that
            doesn't attack humans, it was made by Michael and is named, Blue Fred.</p>
        <img src="images/legHead.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="LegHead">
        <p>Next is Leghead. Leghead is a void creature with four long legs coming out of the top of it's head. Leghead
            uses it's long legs for mostly everything since it's arms are short. Leghead was made from a spider,
            considering it has eight limbs.</p>
        <img src="images/ripper.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="The Ripper">
        <p>The Ripper is made from a cat. They hide in the dark and use their long sharp claws to attack prey. Rippers
            also stay in packs of 5. They used to be aggressive, but they now commanded by something else other than
            Crim.</p>
        <img src="images/spike.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Spike">
        <p>Spike is a void creature that commands all of the Rippers. Spike used to be a human, but he was turned into a
            void creature by Crim. Spike's power was super speed, which is also the power of The Guy's. This is because
            Spike was The Guy's dad. Unlike the other void creatures, Spike doesn't listen to any of Crim's commands, so
            he was able to stop Rippers from harming humans.</p>
        <img src="images/hydra.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Hydra">
        <p>The Hydra is the biggest void creature. The Hydra was made from three different lizards. A chameleon, a
            horned
            lizard, and the komodo dragon. Because of this, the Hydra can change colors. Hydras are regularly a dark
            green color instead of black, they also don't attack unless you provoke them.</p>
            <!-- image slider start for the Stalker -->
            <div id="carouselExampleFade" class="carousel slide carousel-fade container" data-bs-ride="carouse1">
                <div class="carousel-inner">
                  <div class="carousel-item active">
                    <img src="images/stalker.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="The Stalker">
                  </div>
                  <div class="carousel-item">
                    <img src="images/phaseTwo.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="The Stalker second form">
                  </div>
                  <div class="carousel-item">
                    <img src="images/finalStalker.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="The Stalker final form">
                  </div>
                </div>
                <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleFade" data-bs-slide="prev">
                  <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                  <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
                </button>
                <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleFade" data-bs-slide="next">
                  <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                  <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
                </button>
              </div>
            <!-- image slider end for the Stalker -->
        <p>Something similar in looks to the Ripper is the Stalker. The Stalker is the only harmless void creature. And
            just like Spike, they are related to The Guy. The Stalker is Candy who was turned into a void creature. When
            Candy was turned into the Stalker, he gained a new ability, evolution. He was able to grow different part
            and gain different abilities of whoever he stayed around for a period of time. In his final form, the
            Stalker looked like a mini version of Blue Fred.</p>
        <img src="images/megaFred.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Mega Fred">
        <p>Last but deffinetly not least, we have Mega Fred. Mega Fred was the first Fred to be created. It started out
            as a regular Fred, but unlike the others, he acually became friends with Crim. Crim gave them more power,
            and the results were the Fred growing bigger and getting two more limbs on it's back. Mega Fred is the
            antagonist in season 2.</p>
